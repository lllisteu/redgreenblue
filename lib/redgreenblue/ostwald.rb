class RGB

  # Returns a new RGB object with this color's Ostwald full-color.
  #
  # The resulting color contains no white or black,
  # i.e. it has at least one RGB component set to 0, and at least one set to maximum.
  #
  # This is identical (barring very small rounding errors) to setting HSL-saturation to 1, and -lightness to 0.5
